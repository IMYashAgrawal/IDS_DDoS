# IDS_DDoS_DecisionTress
Intrusion Detection System for DDoS attack using Decision Tree.

I made an IDS for a DDos Attack using a Machine Learning Algorithm. I Have used the dataset from Kaggle named DDoS SDN dataset. The accuracy that I got is 100%. Even the recall and precision are also 100%.

I have attached the synopsis, report, and even the presentation along with the dataset and code.
